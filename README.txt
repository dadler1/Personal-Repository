This repository contains most of the major projects that I have worked on over the last few years
excluding games I have written in Unity due to size. These games among several other programs are
available upon personal request. These programs include several written in C, including many parallel
programs as well as a few projects written in MIPS assembly. These projects were chosen specifically
because I feel that they adequately represent my growth as a programmer.
